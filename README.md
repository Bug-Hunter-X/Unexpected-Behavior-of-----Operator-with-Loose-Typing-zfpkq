This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving the '+' operator and loose typing.  The `bug.js` file shows the unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution to ensure consistent numeric addition.  Loose typing in JavaScript is powerful but can easily lead to these kinds of errors.  Proper type checking and handling before operations are crucial for robust JavaScript development.  This example highlights the need to be aware of JavaScript's implicit type coercion and to implement explicit checks when necessary.
